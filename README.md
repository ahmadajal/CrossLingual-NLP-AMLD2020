# CrossLingual-NLP-AMLD2020
Material for the hands-on workshop in the "Applied Machine Learning Days at EPFL 2020"

The notebooks use the [ConceptNet Numberbatch](https://github.com/commonsense/conceptnet-numberbatch) embeddings. We provide a script to download them and extract them. You can do this by: 
```bash
bash download_conceptNet.sh
